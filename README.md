This repository contains the code and data for the research project investigating the effects of bending curvature on the optoelectronic properties of lead-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The focus is on understanding how tensile and compressive strain influence properties such as thermal conductivity, charge carrier mobility, and bandgap energy, and how these effects can be optimized by tuning the halide ion concentration. The findings are crucial for developing flexible, durable PSCs for automotive applications, particularly on non-flat surfaces.

IonMonger and Perovskene github repositories are very good and helped me understand the simulation of perovskite solar cells.

(I am trying to get the new readme file done, so this is definitely not the final description)
